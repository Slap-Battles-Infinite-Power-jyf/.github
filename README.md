## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

**🌀 Distort Space Aura**  
Mimics the Infinity glove’s signature ability—generating a visible aura that stops players from physically touching you. Total defense, zero effort.

**📈 Jump Power Script**  
Boosts your vertical mobility so you can bounce around like a slap-happy kangaroo. Dodge, bait, and leap over enemies effortlessly.

**♾️ Infinite Power Logic**  
Built on Roblox math that interprets anything multiplied by “inf” as infinite. This drives crazy slap strength and physics reactions.

**🔄 Infinite Reverse Mechanics**  
Rewrites physics-based knockbacks to reverse incoming slaps—turning your opponents’ force right back in their smug faces. 😈

**🔥 True Power Amplifier**  
Inspired by the 250 power combo in Slap Royale, this script taps into extreme boosts to escalate every slap to god-tier strength.

**🧠 Mastery-Bypass Enhancer**  
While others grind quests for glove masteries, you auto-unlock their advantages. Mastery? Nah. You *are* the mastery.

**👻 Ghost-Touch Prevention**  
Blocks others from registering hits on you, simulating the immunity effect seen with the Infinity glove’s barrier.

**⚡Velocity Overdrive**  
Pushes body velocity scripts to extremes, creating hyper slaps and movements that look—and feel—unnatural to regular players.
